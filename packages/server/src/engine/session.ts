// @wystack/server — Session (connection-timescale)
//
// Session is the connection-timescale half of the Engine (Spec ADR #8). It owns
// everything that lives for the duration of one connection: the authenticated
// gate, the captured auth token, the handshake timeout, and teardown. It does
// NOT own sockets or close codes — it runs over any `Pipe`, and emits a
// transport-neutral `CloseReason` that the adapter maps to a wire close (the
// Hono WS adapter maps `auth-failed → 4001`, `transient → 4002`; YW-57).
//
// Auth parity with the shipped `routes.ts` handshake is the contract (AC #2).
// The non-obvious behaviors preserved here:
//   - idempotent ACK when already authenticated (no-auth server OR repeat
//     frame) — never adopts/overwrites the token;
//   - double-auth-frame race: `token` is committed only after winning the
//     post-await re-check, so the slower frame cannot swap the winning identity;
//   - anonymous (`token: null`) strips any inherited Authorization header before
//     `resolveContext` runs, so the auth frame is the sole identity source;
//   - the synthetic Bearer `Request` is rebuilt per resolve so adapters see a
//     fresh identity (no cross-call mutation).
//
// Duplicated from `routes.ts` on purpose: YW-56 is additive (the Engine sits
// beside the live routes). YW-57 rewires `routes.ts` through this Session and
// removes the duplication. Editing `routes.ts` here is out of scope.

/**
 * Transport-neutral reason a Session asks the connection to close. The adapter
 * maps it to a wire-level code:
 *   - `auth-failed` — terminal. Bad/missing token, non-auth first frame, or a
 *     protocol violation. The client must NOT retry (WS 4001).
 *   - `transient` — recoverable. Handshake timed out, or the ack send failed
 *     after auth succeeded. The client retries with backoff (WS 4002).

 *
